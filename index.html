			So, I finally insalled Fedora on a disk partition, and I started programming a simple game to help people
			learn linux, so, of course I created a git repo for each of my projects, including my Neovim config, my
			web page and my game called Torvalds Legacy, you can find all of them in my github profile 
			<a href="https://github.com/Eminion14">Eminion14</a>, so if you want, visit my profile and create some pull
			requests, and download, etc., do some classic, github stuff.

        <p>
            I made a PowerPoint presentation, and my parents gave me permission to install Fedora on a partition,
             The only condition is I wait 1 more week until I finish this school year (8th grade btw), if you
             are considering the same, and you either have doubts or you are in my same situation, I recomend to
             do reaserch and analyze every possibility, and if you are in my situation do the same as me or
             whatever you want I honestly can't say anything more.
        </p>

        <h3>14/06/2023</h3>

        <p>I have decided to download fedora on a partition, or if my parents don't like the idea, I will
             install it on an external HDD or SDD because I have both, because I took them out of an old
             computer when I needed to change them, and yea, I would recomendo you to try a distro natively
             after you try them in a VM.
        </p>
        
        <h3>08/06/2021</h3>
        <img src="debian.png">
        <p>I will be trying different Linux distros to determine qhich one I want to install, I will start with
            Debian because it is a very general purpose distro, I have allready tried Kali, hich I liked a lot
            but I also want to try different ones, mybe even including Arch Linux, I recomend anyone that is 
            getting into Linux to do the same and eventually dual boot or replace your current system, I can't do 
            that because I need MS Windows for school, but I will replace my system when I get to High School, if 
            I don't need it...
        </p>

        <h3>06/10/2023</h3>
        <img src="vmware.jpg">
        <p>Today I switch my VM platform to VMware because virtualbox is just so slow and I value speed a lot
            I recomend anyone starting in the VM insustry to start with virtualbox just to get your feet wet
            with virtual machines, but if you are going to use them regularly I would recomend VMware or QEMU
            because they are more eficient and have more features that virtualbox doesn't, but in VMware
            specifically most of them require pro, I personaly dont use pro I can get by without it so yea thats it.

        <p>I have been learning C for about 2 months now and I just started learning functions and I think they
             are very usefull in many use cases.</p>
